# Godot-Steam-API 💨
**Godot Steam integration using GDNative.**

## Getting Started 🏁

1. Download and unzip the Steam SDK: https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip to anywhere on your machine. You must already be a Steam partner (Valve's rules, not mine sorry 🥺).

2. Open the script `res://steam/steam_options.gd`.

3. Edit the variable `app_id` to your steam app id.

4. Edit the variable `sdk_dir` to were you unziped the steam sdk (that you downloaded in step 1).

5. Open the toolscript `res://steam/run_me_once.gd` and run it with: `File > Run`.

6. That's it 🥳! Open `res://example.gd`, edit the achievement name and run the project.
